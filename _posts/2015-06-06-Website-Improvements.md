It's finally the weekend which means that I have more time to work on my website.
I started off by integrating Twitter Bootstrap and now I have a simple yet aesthetically pleasing design.
I downloaded the [template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/portfolio-item/) of my website from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).
