Finally got around to creating my website. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I use Markdown for my posts.  I'll look into adding Twitter Bootstrap to my site and see if that is any better.
I should note that this [awesome tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) helped build my first revision of this website.
